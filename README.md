📝 MNIST Image Recognition with MLP
Implementing Image Recognition on the MNIST Dataset using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9). This project explores the classification task without relying on CNNs, using a simpler fully connected neural network architecture.
